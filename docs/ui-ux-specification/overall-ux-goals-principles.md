# Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas
* **User Who Needs to Find Leads**: This user needs to quickly and efficiently input search queries and receive accurate, well-formatted results. They value speed and clarity.
* **User Who Needs to Monitor Progress**: This user is interested in the status of the long-running workflow. They value clear, real-time feedback and a visually engaging way to track progress.

### Usability Goals
* **Efficiency**: Users should be able to complete their core tasks (submitting a query, viewing results) with minimal friction.
* **Clarity**: The UI should be easy to understand, with clear labels and intuitive interactions.
* **Feedback**: The system should provide immediate and clear feedback on every user action, especially during the long-running workflow.

### Design Principles
* **Neumorphism**: The UI will adhere to a Neumorphism design style, with a cohesive color palette that supports both light and dark modes.
* **Progressive Disclosure**: Only show information when it is needed, for example, displaying the status bar and results table only after a query has been submitted.
* **Visual Hierarchy**: The most important information (e.g., lead data, status updates) should be visually prominent and easy to find.
