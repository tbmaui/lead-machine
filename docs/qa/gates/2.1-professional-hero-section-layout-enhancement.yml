actions_required:
  - "Fix React Hook Rules violation in LeadsSummaryChart (conditional useMemo usage)"
  - "Replace unsafe any types with proper TypeScript interfaces in chart component"
  - "Resolve failing LeadsTable tests to ensure no regressions"
  - "Address critical linting errors before production deployment"
  - "Consider implementing stricter linting rules to prevent future quality degradation"
exit_criteria:
  - "All acceptance criteria fully implemented and functional"
  - "Critical code quality issues must be resolved"
  - "All tests passing without regression"
  - "Visual design requirements met with enhanced neumorphism styling"
  - "Responsive behavior validated across all breakpoints"
  - "Accessibility standards maintained (WCAG AA compliance)"
notes: |
  Implementation successfully delivers all acceptance criteria with high visual quality.
  The enhanced neumorphism design system is well-implemented and the chart scaling issue is resolved.
  However, code quality concerns prevent a clean PASS gate decision.
  
  Performance optimization may be needed for large chunk size (1.7MB), though this appears 
  to be due to external dependencies rather than the current implementation.
  
  The enhanced gradient stroke outline system is properly implemented with CSS custom properties
  and shows good theme compatibility.
  
  Recommend addressing code quality issues promptly to maintain development velocity.
