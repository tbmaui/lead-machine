# =============================================================================
# STORY SCOPE ASSESSMENT
# =============================================================================
scope_expansion:
  original_scope: |
    LinkedIn button styling, search filter simplification, 5-star rating system,
    top/bottom table sliders, search criteria display, column text wrapping, row hover updates
  
  additional_scope_completed: |
    Complete overhaul of lead scoring algorithm from complex weighted system to 
    data-driven completeness-based approach. New prospect classification system 
    replacing "Hot Leads/Warm Leads" terminology with actionable data-focused terms.
    Updated leadScoring.ts with new scoring logic and tier labels.
  
  scope_impact: 'MAJOR - Implementation went beyond UI enhancements to include core business logic improvements'
