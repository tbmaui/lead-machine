  title: "Dynamic Sorting in Leads Table — Brownfield Addition"
review:
  date: "2025-08-22"
  reviewer: "QA (Test Architect)"
summary:
  - "Sorting added to all visible columns with cycle none→asc→desc→none."
  - "Active column shows chevron and exposes aria-sort for a11y."
  - "Comparator stable; handles missing gracefully (last in asc, first in desc)."
  - "Quick-jump and copy controls do not affect sorting."
verification:
  frontend:
    components:
      - src/components/LeadsTable.tsx
    tests:
      - src/components/LeadsTable.test.tsx
  behavior:
    - "Clicking header button toggles sort and updates aria-sort."
    - "Strings compared case-insensitively; numeric score handled correctly."
    - "Derived fields used for company and location."
    - "Only header button clicks toggle sort; links/buttons within cells are safe."

exit_criteria:
  - "All acceptance criteria met for sorting behavior and a11y."
  - "All unit tests pass without regression."
notes: "Recommend manual check with ~5,000 rows to validate UX performance; algorithmic complexity and memoization are appropriate."
