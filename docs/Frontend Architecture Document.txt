# Frontend Architecture Document

## Template and Framework Selection

This section documents the foundational choices for the frontend project and any constraints imposed by the existing codebase.

I have reviewed the `README.md` file from your GitHub repository. It clearly states that the project is built with:
* Vite
* TypeScript
* React
* shadcn-ui
* Tailwind CSS

Since your project already has an existing codebase based on a starter template (`Lovable` which uses Vite and React), my architecture design will align with its established patterns, including the folder structure and styling approach. I will not suggest a new starter template or framework.

**Change Log**

| Change | Date | Version | Description | Author |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Initial draft | 2025-08-18 | 1.0 | Initial architecture based on existing codebase analysis and PRD. | Winston |

## Frontend Tech Stack

This is the DEFINITIVE technology selection section. All development must use these exact versions to ensure consistency and prevent compatibility issues.

**Technology Stack Table**

| Category | Technology | Version | Purpose | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Framework | React | - | Primary UI development framework | Component-based architecture, wide ecosystem, and team familiarity. |
| Language | TypeScript | - | Primary development language | Strong typing, excellent tooling, and improved code quality. |
| UI Library | shadcn-ui | - | Reusable UI components | Provides pre-built, accessible, and customizable components that align with a modern design aesthetic. |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | - | Utility-first CSS framework | Enables rapid UI development and customization. |
| Build Tool | Vite | - | Frontend build tool | Fast development server, hot module replacement, and efficient bundling. |
