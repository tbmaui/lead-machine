# Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Lead Machine's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

**User Personas:**
- **Primary User Segment:** Professional lead generators and sales teams who need to quickly and efficiently find, qualify, and manage prospect data. They are a "Power User" type who values efficiency, actionable data, and a professional, modern interface.
- **Goals:** To reduce the time it takes to find and qualify leads, to have a clear overview of lead quality, and to have a reliable and engaging tool that simplifies their workflow.

**Usability Goals:**
- Ease of use: The new interface must be intuitive and simple to navigate, even with the addition of new features.
- Efficiency of use: Power users must be able to complete their tasks with minimal clicks and distractions.
- Error prevention: Clear validation and confirmation for all actions.
- Performance: The interface must remain responsive and fast, even with large data sets and long-running backend processes.

**Design Principles:**
1.  **Clarity and Cleverness:** The design should be both clear and intuitive, while also incorporating clever and modern elements to create a high-end feel.
2.  **Consistency:** All design patterns, from buttons to animations, must be consistent across the application.
3.  **Visual Appeal:** The design must be aesthetically pleasing, using the numorphism style to create a unique and memorable visual identity.
4.  **Immersive Feedback:** Every user action should have a clear, immediate, and animated response to enhance the user experience.

Navigation Structure:

Primary Navigation: N/A (Single page application)

Secondary Navigation: N/A

Breadcrumb Strategy: N/A

User Flows
Flow Name: Lead Search and Analysis

User Goal: To find and analyze lead data from N8N and other sources.

Entry Points: The user arrives on the main Lead Search Page.

Success Criteria: The user successfully initiates a search, receives real-time updates via the progress bar, and views the final report in an aesthetically pleasing and functional table.

Edge Cases & Error Handling:
Search fails: Display a clear error message in a numorphism-style modal or pop-up.

No results found: Display a friendly "No leads found" message in the table area.

API integration failure: Display a prominent error banner.

Key Screen Layouts:

Search Input Section:

Purpose: The main hero area where users input their search queries.

Key Elements: A redesigned logo, a hero title, and the search input field with a numorphism style.

Progress Bar Section:

Purpose: Provides real-time feedback on the backend search process.

Key Elements: The numorphism-style progress bar with a gradient and real-time status text.

Data Visualization Section:

Purpose: A visual summary of lead quality.

Key Elements: The new numorphism-style pie chart with interactive elements.

Lead Table Section:

Purpose: Displays detailed lead information.

Key Elements: The overhauled table with new columns, dynamic sorting, and quick-jump links.

Component Library / Design System
Design System Approach: We will create a new, modern design system based on the numorphism style for all core components. This will provide a consistent visual language across the entire application.

Core Components:

Buttons: Numorphism-style buttons with hover and press states.

Inputs: Redesigned input fields with a numorphism aesthetic.

Cards: Numorphism-style cards for the main sections of the page.

Progress Bar: The new animated progress bar component with gradient fills and status text.

Pie Chart: A new interactive pie chart component.

Table: A new table component with enhanced functionality like sorting and quick-jumping.

Typography: A modern, clean font that is highly legible.

Branding & Style Guide
Visual Identity: The overall design is numorphism with a unique gradient outline that goes from white in the top-left to dark gray in the bottom-right. This effect is a critical element of the new design.

Color Palette:
| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary Brand | #FFD700 to #32CD32 | Hero, logos, key accents |
| Secondary | #007bff | Interactive elements, highlights |
| Neutral | #f0f0f0, #e0e0e0 | Backgrounds, numorphism shadows |
| Success | #28a745 | Positive feedback, completions |
| Warning | #ffc107 | Cautions, important notices |
| Error | #dc3545 | Errors, destructive actions |

Typography:

Primary Font: Poppins or Inter (clean, modern sans-serif)

Secondary Font: Roboto Mono for code blocks or technical text.

Iconography: A new, consistent icon set that complements the modern numorphism style.

Spacing & Layout: A new grid system and spacing scale will be defined to ensure consistent and organized layouts across all screen sizes.

Accessibility Requirements
Compliance Target: WCAG AA

Key Requirements:

Color contrast ratios: All text and interactive elements must have sufficient contrast.

Keyboard navigation: All interactive components must be fully navigable using a keyboard.

Screen reader support: All components will be tagged with appropriate ARIA attributes.

Text sizing: Text can be resized without breaking the layout.

Responsiveness Strategy
Breakpoints:
| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile | 0px | 767px | Phones (portrait) |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | Tablets (portrait/landscape) |
| Desktop | 1024px | - | Desktops, Laptops |

Adaptation Patterns:

Layout Changes: The layout will fluidly adapt from a single-column mobile view to a multi-column desktop view.

Navigation Changes: The header and hero sections will scale to fit the available space.

Content Priority: The content hierarchy will remain consistent across all devices, ensuring the most important information is always visible.

Animation & Micro-interactions
Motion Principles: All animations should be subtle, fast, and delightful. They should provide clear feedback without being distracting.

Key Animations:

Progress Bar: An animation for filling the bar from 0% to 100%.

Hover States: A numorphism shadow and color change for buttons and cards.

Press States: A subtle "inset" shadow effect for numorphism buttons.

Page Transitions: Smooth animations for page loading and state changes.

Performance Considerations
Performance Goals:

Page Load: < 2 seconds for initial load on a desktop connection.

Interaction Response: < 100ms for all user interactions.

Design Strategies:

Asset Optimization: All images will be optimized for the web to minimize load times.

Lazy Loading: Components and data will be lazy-loaded where possible.

Efficient Animations: Animations will be performed using CSS or efficient JavaScript libraries to avoid performance bottlenecks.
