# Story 3.3: Lead Table UI Enhancements

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user of the Lead Machine application,
**I want** improved visual design and functionality in the leads table with neumorphic styling, star-based grading, better filters, and enhanced user experience,
**so that** I can more effectively review and interact with generated leads while enjoying a polished, professional interface that matches the brand's design system.

## Dev Notes

### Current LeadsTable Component Analysis

[Source: src/components/LeadsTable.tsx analysis]

**CURRENT BUTTON STYLING (Lines 1121-1159):**
```typescript
// LinkedIn buttons currently use buttonVariants with ghost variant
className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant: "ghost", size: "sm" }), "p-1 h-7 w-7")}
```

**CURRENT ROW HOVER (Line 1016):**
```typescript
className="border-b border-border transition-colors hover:bg-accent/30"
```

**CURRENT STAR RENDERING (Lines 77-95):**
```typescript
const renderStars = (score: number) => {
  const starRating = Math.max(1, Math.min(5, Math.floor(score / 20) + 1));
  // Currently uses text-green-500 and text-gray-300
}
```

### Design System Integration Requirements

[Source: .superdesign/design_iterations/complete_controller_design_system_docs.md]

**BRAND COLORS TO USE:**
- **Tomato Orange**: `#f36334` - For primary actions and pressed states (light mode)  
- **Sea Green**: `#91bfa5` - For secondary actions and pressed states (dark mode)
- **Dim Colors**: `#566e67` and `#5d5d5f` - For muted elements
- **Gray**: `#7c797c` - For neutral elements

**NEUMORPHIC BUTTON STYLING:**
- **Background**: Surface color with light gradient
- **Shadow**: Raised effect using `--raise` CSS variable  
- **Pressed State**: Inset shadow with brand color text and border
- **Border**: 1px solid stroke color
- **Border Radius**: `50px` for circular buttons

**HOVER STATE COLORS:**
- **Light Mode**: Use tomato orange variations for hover
- **Dark Mode**: Use sea green variations for hover

### Current Filter Implementation

[Source: src/components/LeadsTable.tsx:22-29]

**FILTERS TO REMOVE:**
- `text` filters for name, title, company, email, location, industry
- `scoreMin` and `scoreMax` range filters

**FILTERS TO KEEP:**
- `hasEmail` boolean filter
- `hasPhone` boolean filter

### Table Structure and Resizing

[Source: src/components/LeadsTable.tsx:886-1187]

**CURRENT TABLE CONFIGURATION:**
```typescript
<table className="w-full border-collapse resize-table" style={{ minWidth: '1400px', tableLayout: 'fixed' }}>
```

**RESIZING BEHAVIOR:**
- Uses `tableLayout: 'fixed'` which requires text wrapping implementation
- Columns have fixed widths but are manually resizable
- Need to add `word-wrap: break-word` and `overflow-wrap: break-word` to cells

### Star Rating Color Specification

**REQUIRED COLOR MAPPING:**
- **5 Stars**: Golden Rod (#dfb809) - Highest quality leads
- **4 Stars**: Light Sea Green (#a9ccb8) - High quality leads  
- **3 Stars**: Dark Sea Green (#6f927e) - Medium quality leads
- **2 Stars**: Tomato (#f47146) - Lower quality leads
- **1 Star**: Peach Puff (#fbc8b7) - Lowest quality leads

### Search Criteria Display Requirements

**DATA TO DISPLAY:**
- Target Location (from LeadGenForm targetLocation state)
- Selected Industries (from selectedIndustries array)  
- Company Sizes (from selectedCompanySizes array)
- Job Titles (from selectedJobTitles array)
- Lead Count (from leadCount slider value)

**VISUAL FORMAT:**
- Use neumorphic card styling consistent with design system
- Group related criteria with clear labels
- Make information scannable with appropriate typography hierarchy
- Position above LeadsTable in LeadGenResults component

### Horizontal Slider Implementation

**CURRENT BOTTOM SLIDER:**
- Located at bottom of table container
- Provides horizontal navigation for wide tables
- Need to duplicate and sync with top position

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Identical functionality and styling between top and bottom sliders
- Synchronized scroll position updates
- Mobile-responsive behavior
- Consistent with neumorphic design system

### File Structure Context

[Source: Project structure analysis]

**PRIMARY FILES TO MODIFY:**
- `src/components/LeadsTable.tsx` - Main table component with all styling updates
- `src/components/LeadGenResults.tsx` - Add search criteria display component
- `src/hooks/useLeadGeneration.ts` - Ensure search criteria are preserved
- `src/lib/filters.ts` - Update filter logic for simplified filter set

**NEW COMPONENTS TO CREATE:**
- `src/components/SearchCriteriaDisplay.tsx` - Display original search parameters
- Update existing neumorphic CSS classes for button styling

### Technical Constraints

**CRITICAL PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **NEVER break real-time subscriptions**: Supabase subscriptions for lead updates must remain intact
- **NEVER break N8N webhooks**: Lead generation workflow integration cannot be affected
- **NEVER break existing functionality**: All current table features must continue working
- **Maintain accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance for all interactive elements
- **Preserve data integrity**: Lead scoring and display logic must remain accurate

**PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:**
- Text wrapping should not impact table rendering performance
- Star rating calculations should remain memoized for large datasets
- Filter simplification should improve rather than degrade performance
- Slider synchronization should be efficient and smooth

### Testing Requirements

[Source: Project testing patterns analysis]

**REQUIRED TEST COVERAGE:**
- Button interaction tests for neumorphic styling
- Filter functionality tests with simplified filter set  
- Star rating display accuracy tests
- Table navigation and resizing tests
- Search criteria display component tests
- Accessibility compliance validation tests

**TEST FILES TO UPDATE:**
- `src/components/LeadsTable.test.tsx` - Update for new styling and functionality
- Create tests for SearchCriteriaDisplay component
- Integration tests for complete lead table workflow

### Integration with Existing Architecture

**COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE ALIGNMENT:**
- Follow existing shadcn/ui pattern for component composition
- Maintain TypeScript strict typing for all new interfaces
- Use existing utility functions and hooks where appropriate
- Preserve existing lead scoring and filtering logic

**STYLING ARCHITECTURE:**
- Use Tailwind CSS classes following established patterns
- Integrate neumorphic design system variables and classes
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Follow established component styling conventions

### Project Structure Alignment

[Source: docs/lead-machine-brownfield-frontend-architecture-document/project-structure.md]

All UI enhancements align with established project structure:
- Component modifications follow `/src/components/` organization
- New utility components follow existing naming patterns
- Styling follows established Tailwind + neumorphic approach
- No structural conflicts with current architecture
