# Story 3.1: Secure Environment Configuration

## Status

Review

## Story

**As a** client receiving the Lead Machine application for production use,
**I want** all database credentials and API keys to be securely managed through environment variables instead of being hardcoded in the source code,
**so that** my production deployment is secure, credentials can be rotated without code changes, and there is no risk of accidental credential exposure through version control or code sharing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Remove Hardcoded Credentials**
   - Remove all hardcoded Supabase credentials from `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
   - Remove any other hardcoded API keys, tokens, or sensitive configuration from source code
   - Ensure no credentials are committed to version control in any form

2. **Implement Environment Variable Configuration**
   - Configure Supabase client to read credentials from environment variables
   - Add proper environment variable validation with meaningful error messages
   - Create separate environment configurations for development, staging, and production

3. **Secure Build Process**
   - Update build process to validate required environment variables are present
   - Add environment-specific configuration loading and validation
   - Ensure build fails gracefully if required environment variables are missing

4. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Update `.env.example` with all required environment variables and clear documentation
   - Create environment variable setup documentation for production deployment
   - Add troubleshooting guide for common environment configuration issues

5. **Validation & Error Handling**
   - Add runtime validation that fails fast if critical environment variables are missing
   - Implement proper error messages that guide users to fix configuration issues
   - Add health check endpoint that validates environment configuration status

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Production Readiness Assessment: Critical security vulnerability identified with hardcoded Supabase credentials exposed in source code. This creates HIGH risk for credential exposure through version control, code sharing, or deployment artifacts. Must be resolved before any production deployment.

### Tech Stack Context

[Source: CLAUDE.md, package.json]

- **Framework**: Vite + React with TypeScript for secure build-time environment variable injection
- **Environment Variables**: Vite uses `import.meta.env` for environment variable access
- **Build System**: Vite supports environment-specific builds with proper variable validation
- **Testing**: Vitest framework with jsdom environment for testing configuration scenarios

### Security Requirements

[Source: Production Readiness Assessment, Epic 3 definition]

- **Zero Tolerance**: No hardcoded credentials allowed in source code or version control
- **Environment Separation**: Clear separation between development, staging, and production configurations
- **Validation Required**: Build process must fail if required environment variables are missing
- **Runtime Checks**: Application must validate configuration on startup and provide health checks

### Current Configuration Analysis

[Source: Current codebase analysis]

**CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED:**

```typescript
// src/integrations/supabase/client.ts - MUST BE FIXED
const SUPABASE_URL = "https://ooucjycpduxmnkxhjgtk.supabase.co"; // ❌ HARDCODED
const SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."; // ❌ HARDCODED
```

**EXISTING ENVIRONMENT FILES:**
- `.env` - Contains production credentials (HIGH RISK - should not be in repo)  
- `.env.local` - Development overrides (OK to exist locally)
- `.env.example` - Template file (needs comprehensive documentation)

### Secure Implementation Pattern

[Source: Vite documentation, security best practices]

**REQUIRED CHANGES:**

```typescript
// src/integrations/supabase/client.ts - SECURE VERSION
const SUPABASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

// Add validation
if (!SUPABASE_URL || !SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
  throw new Error('Missing required Supabase configuration. Check your environment variables.');
}
```

**REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous/public key  
- `VITE_FEATURE_HERO_V2` - Feature flag configuration

### File Structure and Locations

[Source: Current project structure analysis]

**FILES TO MODIFY:**
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - Remove hardcoded credentials, add environment loading
- `vite.config.ts` - Add environment variable validation
- `.env.example` - Comprehensive environment variable documentation
- `package.json` - Add environment validation scripts

**FILES TO CREATE:**
- `src/lib/env-validation.ts` - Environment variable validation utilities
- `src/lib/health-check.ts` - Environment health check functionality  
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Production deployment documentation
- `.env.production.example` - Production environment template

**FILES TO SECURE:**
- `.env` - Must be removed from version control and added to .gitignore
- Any backup files containing credentials must be secured

### Environment Variable Validation Strategy

[Source: Security best practices, Vite configuration patterns]

**VALIDATION LAYERS:**
1. **Build Time**: Vite configuration validates required variables before build
2. **Runtime**: Application startup validates configuration and fails fast
3. **Health Check**: API endpoint provides configuration status for monitoring
4. **Development**: Clear error messages guide developers to fix configuration issues

**VALIDATION FUNCTIONS:**

```typescript
// src/lib/env-validation.ts
export function validateEnvironment() {
  const required = [
    'VITE_SUPABASE_URL',
    'VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'
  ];
  
  const missing = required.filter(key => !import.meta.env[key]);
  
  if (missing.length > 0) {
    throw new Error(`Missing required environment variables: ${missing.join(', ')}`);
  }
}
```
