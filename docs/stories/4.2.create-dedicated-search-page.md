## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**Story 4.1**: Landing page refactored with CTAs that navigate to `/search` route. This story implements the destination page for those navigation actions.

### Component Architecture Dependencies
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Directory Structure & Critical System Components]
- **LeadGenForm**: Existing component at `src/components/LeadGenForm.tsx` - move to new page without modification
- **LeadGenResults**: Component that displays search results - ensure continues to work
- **useLeadGeneration Hook**: Located at `src/hooks/useLeadGeneration.ts` - preserve all functionality
- **Authentication**: Uses `useAuth` hook - maintain existing auth patterns

### Critical Brownfield Integration Points
[Source: Epic 4 constraints & Current codebase]
- **LeadGenForm Current Location**: Currently in `src/pages/Index.tsx` lines 37-43
- **Existing Props Interface**: 
  ```typescript
  interface LeadGenFormProps {
    userId: string;
    restoredSearch?: {job: any, leads: any[]} | null;
    onSearchRestored?: () => void;
  }
  ```
- **Must Preserve**: All existing prop interfaces for backward compatibility
- **State Management**: Current implementation uses useLeadGeneration hook - keep identical

### Real-time System Architecture
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Critical System Components]
- **Job Lifecycle**: `pending` → `processing` → `searching` → `enriching` → `validating` → `finalizing` → `completed`
- **Progress Simulation**: Merges real backend updates with simulated intermediate steps
- **Supabase Subscriptions**: Real-time job and lead updates - must function identically
- **Database Tables**: `lead_gen_jobs` and `leads` - no changes to schema or queries

### Technology Stack Integration
[Source: docs/frontend-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]
- **React Router**: Use `useSearchParams` for URL parameter handling
- **Authentication**: Maintain existing `useAuth` hook integration
- **Styling**: Preserve neumorphic design system with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Continue using existing patterns with useLeadGeneration

### File Structure Requirements
[Source: docs/frontend-architecture/project-structure.md]
- **New Page Location**: `src/pages/Search.tsx`
- **Route Configuration**: Update main router (likely in App.tsx)
- **Component Imports**: Import existing components without modification

### Current LeadGenForm Features to Preserve
[Source: Current implementation analysis]
- **Search Inputs**: Target location, industries, company sizes, job titles
- **Validation**: All existing form validation rules
- **Submission**: Webhook trigger to N8N workflow
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress tracking and status display
- **Results Display**: LeadGenResults component integration
- **Error Handling**: Existing error states and user feedback

### Demo Mode Implementation
[Source: Story 4.1 CTA requirements]
- **URL Parameter**: `?demo=true` from "Try It Free" CTA
- **Pre-fill Logic**: Austin TX, Professional Services, 1-50 employees, CEO/Owner/VP titles
- **Demo Banner**: Clear indication when in demo mode
- **Conversion Path**: Easy transition from demo to real search

### Authentication Flow Preservation
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Authentication System]
- **Protected Route**: Search page requires authentication
- **Redirect Logic**: Unauthenticated users redirect to login with return URL
- **User Context**: Pass authenticated user.id to LeadGenForm
- **Session Management**: Preserve existing session handling

### Performance Considerations
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Development Workflow]
- **Code Splitting**: Search page should load efficiently
- **Component Reuse**: No duplication of existing components
- **Bundle Size**: Minimal impact on overall application size
- **Loading States**: Maintain existing loading UX patterns

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: 
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Development Workflow & Testing Strategy]
- **Framework**: Vitest with jsdom environment
- **Coverage**: Focus on search functionality and navigation
- **Commands**: `npm run test`, `npm run test:watch`, `npm run coverage`
- **Quality Gates**: `npm run lint` and TypeScript checking

**Critical Test Cases**:
- **Functional**: All search inputs work identically to current implementation
- **Real-time**: Job progress and results display function exactly as before
- **Authentication**: Login flow and protected route behavior
- **Navigation**: CTA clicks from landing page work correctly
- **Demo Mode**: URL parameters properly trigger demo pre-fill
- **Responsive**: Mobile and desktop layouts work correctly
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Regression**: Existing functionality unaffected by changes

**Test File Locations**:
- `src/pages/__tests__/Search.test.tsx` - Main page functionality
- Integration tests for navigation flow between pages
- Component tests for demo mode functionality

### Security Considerations
[Source: Epic 4 brownfield constraints]
- **Route Protection**: Ensure only authenticated users access search page
- **State Validation**: Validate URL parameters to prevent injection
- **Session Security**: Maintain existing authentication security measures
- **Data Privacy**: Preserve existing data handling and privacy controls
