# Story 2.1: Professional Hero Section & Layout Enhancement

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** professional lead generator and sales team member,
**I want** a refined, professional hero section with improved layout and enhanced neumorphism styling,
**so that** I can experience a more polished, high-end interface that reflects the premium quality of the lead generation tool while maintaining excellent usability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Hero Section Enhancement**
   - Redesign the hero section with a more focused, professional layout that reduces visual clutter
   - Implement the signature neumorphism gradient stroke outline (light top-left to dark bottom-right) around key elements
   - Improve typography hierarchy and spacing for better visual impact
   - Maintain responsive design across all breakpoints (mobile: 0-767px, tablet: 768-1023px, desktop: 1024px+)

2. **Search Query Interface Refinement**
   - Relocate and redesign the search form interface for better user focus and workflow
   - Apply enhanced neumorphism styling with gradient stroke outlines to form elements
   - Improve the popover interactions and visual feedback for industry, company size, and job title selections
   - Maintain all existing functionality while improving the visual presentation

3. **Lead Results Display Optimization**
   - Optimize the layout flow from search → progress → results for better user experience
   - Enhance with Neumorphism style the pie chart display above the lead table with improved positioning and styling. Shrink it down so it's in better scale with the rest of the page. It's now about 500% too large when it's on a big page. When it's on a phone screen it looks appropriately scaled, but not when it's on a PC or a tablet.
   - Apply consistent neumorphism styling with gradient stroke outlines to data visualization elements
   - Ensure the leads table integration remains seamless with the new layout

4. **Professional Visual Enhancement**
   - Implement the gradient stroke outline system (--neu-highlight to --neu-shadow-dark transition)
   - Enhance the overall page composition for a more high-end, professional appearance
   - Maintain consistency with the established neumorphism design system
   - Ensure all interactive elements have proper hover/focus states with enhanced visual feedback

5. **Layout Structure Optimization**
   - Improve the overall page layout structure for better content organization
   - Optimize spacing, positioning, and visual hierarchy throughout the interface
   - Maintain the existing max-width constraints (1600px) while improving content presentation
   - Ensure seamless integration between all page sections
