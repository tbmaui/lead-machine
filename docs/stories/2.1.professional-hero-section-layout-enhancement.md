# Story 2.1: Professional Hero Section & Layout Enhancement

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** professional lead generator and sales team member,
**I want** a refined, professional hero section with improved layout and enhanced neumorphism styling,
**so that** I can experience a more polished, high-end interface that reflects the premium quality of the lead generation tool while maintaining excellent usability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Hero Section Enhancement**

   - Redesign the hero section with a more focused, professional layout that reduces visual clutter
   - Implement the signature neumorphism gradient stroke outline (light top-left to dark bottom-right) around key elements
   - Improve typography hierarchy and spacing for better visual impact
   - Maintain responsive design across all breakpoints (mobile: 0-767px, tablet: 768-1023px, desktop: 1024px+)

2. **Search Query Interface Refinement**

   - Relocate and redesign the search form interface for better user focus and workflow
   - Apply enhanced neumorphism styling with gradient stroke outlines to form elements
   - Improve the popover interactions and visual feedback for industry, company size, and job title selections
   - Maintain all existing functionality while improving the visual presentation

3. **Lead Results Display Optimization**

   - Optimize the layout flow from search â†’ progress â†’ results for better user experience
   - Enhance with Neumorphism style the pie chart display above the lead table with improved positioning and styling. Shrink it down so it's in better scale with the rest of the page. It's now about 500% too large when it's on a big page. When it's on a phone screen it looks appropriately scaled, but not when it's on a PC or a tablet.
   - Apply consistent neumorphism styling with gradient stroke outlines to data visualization elements
   - Ensure the leads table integration remains seamless with the new layout

4. **Professional Visual Enhancement**

   - Implement the gradient stroke outline system (--neu-highlight to --neu-shadow-dark transition)
   - Enhance the overall page composition for a more high-end, professional appearance
   - Maintain consistency with the established neumorphism design system
   - Ensure all interactive elements have proper hover/focus states with enhanced visual feedback

5. **Layout Structure Optimization**
   - Improve the overall page layout structure for better content organization
   - Optimize spacing, positioning, and visual hierarchy throughout the interface
   - Maintain the existing max-width constraints (1600px) while improving content presentation
   - Ensure seamless integration between all page sections

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Epic 1 completion: The leads table has been successfully enhanced with proper data mapping, LinkedIn URL functionality, location extraction, and industry parsing. The neumorphism design system foundation has been established and is working well.

### Tech Stack Context

[Source: docs/frontend-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and component-based architecture
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility-first framework for rapid UI development
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui for accessible and customizable components
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development server with HMR

### Design System Foundation

[Source: docs/brownfield - ui inspiration+examples/neumorphism-design-system.md]

- **Existing Classes**: `.neu-flat`, `.neu-raised`, `.neu-elevated`, `.neu-inset`, `.neu-pressed`
- **Shadow System**: Dual shadows with positive/negative values using CSS custom properties
- **Theme Support**: Light and dark theme compatibility with automatic detection
- **CSS Variables**: `--neu-highlight`, `--neu-shadow`, `--neu-shadow-dark` for consistent theming

### Enhanced Styling Requirements

[Source: docs/brownfield-ui-ux-specification-document/introduction.md]

- **Gradient Stroke Outline**: Light top-left to dark bottom-right gradient border effect
- **Color Palette**: Primary brand colors (#FFD700 to #32CD32), Secondary (#007bff), Neutral grays
- **Typography**: Poppins or Inter for clean, modern sans-serif styling
- **Visual Identity**: Unique gradient outline effect as critical design element

### Component File Locations

[Source: Current project structure]

- **Main Page**: `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Overall page layout and component orchestration
- **Hero Section**: `src/components/ui/hero-section.tsx` - Current hero implementation
- **Lead Gen Form**: `src/components/LeadGenForm.tsx` - Search interface and form handling
- **Results Display**: `src/components/LeadGenResults.tsx` - Results page wrapper
- **Summary Chart**: `src/components/LeadsSummaryChart.tsx` - Pie chart visualization
- **Styling**: `src/index.css` - Global styles and neumorphism utilities

### API and State Management

[Source: Current implementation]

- **Lead Generation Hook**: `src/hooks/useLeadGeneration.ts` - Manages form submission and results state
- **Supabase Integration**: `src/integrations/supabase/` - Backend data handling
- **State Flow**: Form â†’ API call â†’ Real-time updates â†’ Results display (no changes needed)

### Testing Standards

Testing location: Components should have corresponding `.test.tsx` files in the same directory
Test framework: Vitest with React Testing Library (as established in existing tests)
Testing requirements: Visual regression tests for layout changes, accessibility testing, responsive behavior validation

### Technical Constraints

- Maintain all existing functionality from Epic 1 (lead generation workflow, data display, filtering, sorting)
- Preserve responsive design patterns established in current implementation
- Ensure theme switching compatibility between light and dark modes
- No breaking changes to underlying data structures or API integrations
