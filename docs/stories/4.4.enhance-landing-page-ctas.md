## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**Story 4.1**: Basic CTAs added to hero section for navigation
**Story 4.2**: Search page created to receive CTA traffic
**Story 4.3**: State persistence enables demo mode pre-filling
**Story 4.4**: This story enhances CTA conversion effectiveness with compelling copy, social proof, and strategic placement

### CTA Conversion Strategy
[Source: Architect's CTA optimization plan]
- **Primary Focus**: "Get Leads Now" - main conversion action
- **Secondary Focus**: "Try It Free" - lower barrier entry with demo
- **Educational**: "Try Score Calculator" - value demonstration
- **Contextual**: Strategic placement throughout information sections

### Current CTA Implementation
[Source: Story 4.1 implementation]
**Hero Section CTAs**: Basic navigation buttons implemented
```typescript
<Button onClick={() => navigate('/search')}>Get Leads Now</Button>
<Button onClick={() => navigate('/search?demo=true')}>Try It Free</Button>
```
**Enhancement Target**: Add compelling copy, urgency, social proof

### CTA Variant Testing Framework
[Source: A/B testing strategy]
```typescript
export const CTA_VARIANTS = {
  primary: [
    "Get Leads Now",
    "Start Finding Leads", 
    "Generate Quality Leads",
    "Find Your Next Customers"
  ],
  secondary: [
    "Try It Free",
    "See Demo",
    "Test Drive", 
    "Preview Results"
  ]
};
```
- **Implementation**: Random or user-based assignment
- **Tracking**: Analytics integration for performance measurement
- **Feature Flags**: Environment variable control for testing

### Neumorphic Design System Integration
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Architecture Overview & Existing Implementation]
- **Existing Classes**: `neu-element`, `neu-green`, `neu-orange`, `neu-raised`
- **Design Consistency**: All CTAs must maintain neumorphic styling
- **Color Strategy**: Green for primary actions, orange for secondary
- **Hover States**: `hover:neu-raised` for interactive feedback
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast and focus indicators

### Demo Mode Enhancement Requirements
[Source: Story 4.3 state persistence & Current demo implementation]
**Current Demo Config**: Basic pre-fill from URL parameter `?demo=true`
**Enhanced Demo Config**:
```typescript
const demoConfig = {
  location: "Austin, TX",
  industries: ["Professional Services", "Healthcare"], 
  companySizes: ["1-50", "51-200"],
  jobTitles: ["CEO", "Owner", "VP"],
  employeeRange: [10, 200],
  showDemoBanner: true,
  previewMode: true
};
```

### Component Enhancement Locations
[Source: Current landing page structure]
- **HeroSection**: `src/components/ui/hero-section.tsx` - Primary CTA enhancement
- **OverviewSection**: `src/components/OverviewSection.tsx` - Contextual CTA addition
- **LeadScoreCalculation**: `src/components/LeadScoreCalculation.tsx` - Educational CTA
- **QuickStartInstructions**: Already has CTA from Story 4.1

### Mobile Optimization Requirements
[Source: Responsive design standards]
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px per Apple/Google guidelines
- **Thumb Zone**: Primary actions in comfortable reach areas
- **Stack Layout**: CTAs stack vertically on mobile screens
- **Simplified Copy**: Shorter text for mobile readability
- **Gesture Support**: Tap feedback and loading states

### Trust Signal Integration Points
[Source: Conversion optimization best practices]
- **Hero Section**: Customer count, leads generated statistics
- **Below CTAs**: "No credit card required • Setup in under 5 minutes"
- **Social Proof**: "Join 500+ sales teams" or similar metrics
- **Risk Reversal**: "Cancel anytime" or "100% satisfaction guarantee"
- **Urgency**: "Free for first 100 leads" or limited-time offers

### Analytics and Performance Tracking
[Source: CTA optimization requirements]
- **Click Tracking**: Track CTA performance by variant and location
- **Conversion Funnel**: Landing page → CTA click → Search page → Lead generation
- **A/B Test Results**: Measure conversion rate improvements
- **User Behavior**: Heatmaps and scroll depth analysis

### Accessibility Enhancement Requirements
[Source: WCAG 2.1 compliance standards]
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All CTAs accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Color Contrast**: Maintain accessibility standards with neumorphic design
- **Alternative Text**: Descriptive text for any visual elements

### Performance Impact Considerations
[Source: Current application performance requirements]
- **Bundle Size**: Keep CTA enhancements lightweight
- **Loading Speed**: Don't impact initial page load times
- **Rendering**: Avoid layout shifts during CTA rendering
- **Images**: Optimize any new visual assets

### Testing
**Testing Standards**:
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Development Workflow]
- **Framework**: Vitest for component testing, analytics mock testing
- **User Testing**: A/B test different CTA variants
- **Accessibility**: axe-core integration for automated a11y testing
- **Performance**: Lighthouse audits for impact assessment

**Critical Test Scenarios**:
- **CTA Functionality**: All buttons navigate correctly
- **Responsive Behavior**: CTAs work across all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- **A/B Testing**: Variant selection and tracking work correctly
- **Demo Mode**: "Try It Free" properly pre-fills demo data
- **Visual Regression**: Enhanced CTAs don't break existing layouts
- **Performance**: No degradation in page load times
- **Analytics**: Click tracking and conversion measurement

**Test File Locations**:
- `src/lib/__tests__/cta-variants.test.ts` - CTA variant system
- `src/components/__tests__/HeroSection.test.tsx` - Enhanced hero CTAs
- `src/components/__tests__/OverviewSection.test.tsx` - Contextual CTAs
- `src/components/__tests__/LeadScoreCalculation.test.tsx` - Educational CTAs
- Integration tests for complete CTA conversion flow

### Browser Compatibility
[Source: Application browser support requirements]
- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge latest versions
- **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
- **Feature Detection**: Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **Polyfills**: Ensure CTA functionality works across targets
