## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**Story 4.1**: Landing page CTAs navigate to `/search`
**Story 4.2**: Basic search page created with simple back navigation
**Story 4.3**: State persistence enables search restoration
**Story 4.4**: Enhanced CTAs drive more traffic to search page
**Story 4.5**: This story creates sophisticated navigation and workflow-optimized layouts

### Search Workflow Architecture
[Source: Architect's workflow design & CLAUDE.md#Critical System Components]
**Job Status Transitions**: `pending` → `processing` → `searching` → `enriching` → `validating` → `finalizing` → `completed`

**Workflow Steps Mapping**:
```typescript
const SEARCH_STEPS = [
  { id: 'setup', label: 'Search Setup', icon: Target, statuses: ['idle'] },
  { id: 'processing', label: 'Finding Leads', icon: Search, statuses: ['pending', 'processing', 'searching'] },  
  { id: 'enriching', label: 'Enriching Data', icon: Sparkles, statuses: ['enriching', 'validating'] },
  { id: 'results', label: 'View Results', icon: BarChart, statuses: ['finalizing', 'completed'] }
];
```

### Current Search Page Structure
[Source: Story 4.2 implementation]
**Basic Structure**: Simple header with back navigation, main content area
**Enhancement Target**: Sophisticated workflow-aware navigation and adaptive layouts
**Existing Components**: LeadGenForm, LeadGenResults integrated successfully
**Integration Points**: useLeadGeneration hook provides job status for progress tracking

### Layout Component Architecture
[Source: Component design pattern]
```typescript
interface SearchPageLayoutProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  currentStep?: 'setup' | 'searching' | 'results';
  showBackNav?: boolean;
  breadcrumbs?: Array<{label: string, href?: string}>;
}
```
**Design Pattern**: Layout wrapper that adapts to workflow state
**Flexibility**: Support for different content types and navigation needs

### Navigation System Requirements
[Source: Advanced navigation strategy]
- **Multi-Level**: Home > Search > Results with proper breadcrumbs
- **Browser Integration**: Proper history management and back button support
- **Shortcuts**: Quick access to common actions at each workflow step
- **Context Awareness**: Different navigation options based on current step

### Progress Indicator Integration
[Source: Real-time job status system]
**Data Source**: useLeadGeneration hook provides `currentJob.status`
**Real-time Updates**: Progress indicators update as job status changes
**Visual Design**: Neumorphic styling consistent with application theme
**User Feedback**: Clear indication of current step and estimated completion

### Adaptive Layout Strategy
[Source: UX optimization for different workflow phases]

**Setup Phase (Form-Focused)**:
```typescript
<div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
  <SearchForm />
</div>
```

**Processing Phase (Progress-Focused)**:
```typescript
<div className="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center">
  <SearchProgress />
  <SearchStatus />
</div>
```

**Results Phase (Data-Focused)**:
```typescript
<div className="max-w-[1600px] mx-auto">
  <ResultsSummary />
  <ResultsTable />
  <ResultsCharts />
</div>
```

### Action Bar Context Switching
[Source: Contextual actions design]
**Setup Phase Actions**: Template loading, form management, clear operations
**Processing Phase Actions**: Job control (pause, cancel, status)
**Results Phase Actions**: Data export, CRM integration, new search initiation
**Implementation**: Conditional rendering based on workflow step

### Keyboard Shortcuts Design
[Source: Accessibility and power user features]
```typescript
const SHORTCUTS = {
  'Ctrl+Enter': 'Start Search',
  'Ctrl+N': 'New Search', 
  'Ctrl+S': 'Save Template',
  'Escape': 'Cancel/Back',
  'Ctrl+E': 'Export Results'
};
```
**Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation support
**User Experience**: Optional shortcuts for power users
**Conflict Avoidance**: Don't override browser or form shortcuts

### Search History Integration
[Source: State persistence from Story 4.3]
**Data Source**: Session storage utilities from Story 4.3
**Functionality**: Quick access to recent searches, template management
**User Experience**: One-click search restoration and modification
**Privacy**: Session-scoped data, respects user privacy

### Responsive Design Requirements
[Source: Mobile-first approach]
- **Mobile**: Single column, stacked navigation, simplified actions
- **Tablet**: Balanced layout, accessible touch targets
- **Desktop**: Full width utilization, multiple columns, advanced features
- **Accessibility**: Works with screen readers, keyboard navigation

### Integration with Existing Components
[Source: Brownfield integration requirements]
**Preserve Functionality**: All existing LeadGenForm and LeadGenResults functionality
**Enhance Experience**: Layer navigation and layout improvements over existing code
**State Management**: Work with existing useLeadGeneration hook without modification
**Styling**: Maintain neumorphic design consistency

### Error Handling and Edge Cases
[Source: Robust navigation system requirements]
- **Network Issues**: Graceful handling of connectivity problems
- **Invalid States**: Handle unexpected job statuses or navigation states
- **Browser Issues**: Fallback navigation for history API problems  
- **User Errors**: Clear recovery paths for user mistakes

### Performance Considerations
[Source: Application performance requirements]
- **Lazy Loading**: Load navigation components as needed
- **Efficient Updates**: Minimize re-renders during real-time updates
- **Memory Management**: Clean up event listeners and subscriptions
- **Bundle Impact**: Keep new components lightweight

### Testing
**Testing Standards**:
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Development Workflow]
- **Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library for component testing
- **Integration**: Test complete navigation flows end-to-end
- **Accessibility**: axe-core for automated accessibility testing
- **Responsive**: Test layouts across viewport sizes

**Critical Test Scenarios**:
- **Navigation Flow**: Landing page → Search → Results with proper state
- **Progress Indicators**: Accurately reflect real-time job status updates
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Proper layout switching based on workflow step
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full accessibility via keyboard only
- **Action Bars**: Context-appropriate actions available at each step
- **Search History**: Template saving, loading, and management
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of navigation failures
- **Responsive Behavior**: Layouts work across all screen sizes
- **Browser Compatibility**: Navigation works across supported browsers

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and navigation landmarks
- **ARIA Labels**: Descriptive labels for complex navigation elements
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order and visible focus indicators
- **Screen Readers**: Navigation announcements and state changes
- **Keyboard Only**: Full functionality accessible without mouse
