# Story 1.4: Quick-Jumping Links in Lead Table

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** sales user,
**I want** quick-jumping links for LinkedIn and Website directly in each lead row,
**so that** I can open prospect profiles fast without manual copy/paste.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Each lead row shows a LinkedIn icon/button when `linkedin_url` exists; clicking opens in a new tab.
2. Each lead row shows a Website icon/button when `website_url` exists; clicking opens in a new tab.
3. Links include `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
4. When a URL field is missing, no empty icon or placeholder is rendered; table layout remains stable.
5. Implementation follows existing table cell renderer pattern and styling conventions.
6. Sorting, pagination, and row selection behavior remain unchanged; clicking a link does not trigger sort or select.
7. Unit tests cover conditional rendering, accessibility labels, and link behaviors.
8. Update any relevant UI documentation/readme for the table component.
9. Verify no regression on existing columns and interactions.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add conditional LinkedIn link/button renderer for rows with `linkedin_url` (AC: 1,3,4,6)
- [ ] Add conditional Website link/button renderer for rows with `website_url` (AC: 2,3,4,6)
- [ ] Ensure links use `target` and `rel` attributes and stop propagation to table row events (AC: 3,6)
- [ ] Apply consistent styling using Tailwind and existing button/icon components (AC: 5)
- [ ] Write unit tests (conditional rendering, a11y labels, link attributes, event handling) (AC: 7)
- [ ] Update component-level documentation/readme as needed (AC: 8)
- [ ] Manual regression pass for sorting/pagination/selection unaffected (AC: 6,9)

## Dev Notes

- Integration with existing lead table component renderers; no API/schema changes needed (reads existing `linkedin_url` and `website_url` fields).
- Tech stack per Frontend Architecture: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui; build with Vite.
- Testing per architecture guidance: use @testing-library/react; follow Arrange-Act-Assert; mock external calls (not needed here).

### Testing

- Place tests alongside component (e.g., `src/components/.../*.test.tsx`).
- Aim for 80%+ coverage on new/changed files.
- Verify link opens with correct attributes and does not trigger row-level events.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

GPT-5 (Cursor) — Dev Agent `James`

### Debug Log References

- Added Vitest + Testing Library setup and executed passing unit tests.
- Ensured links stop event propagation and have required security attributes.

### Completion Notes List

- Implemented conditional LinkedIn and Website quick-jump buttons in `LeadsTable`.
- Used shadcn `buttonVariants` with `ghost` styling for icon buttons.
- Added aria-labels for accessibility; links open in new tab with `rel`.
- Created unit tests covering rendering and attributes; all tests pass.
- Updated README with quick-jump behavior and test command.

### File List

- `src/components/LeadsTable.tsx` — link buttons, a11y, stopPropagation
- `src/components/LeadsTable.test.tsx` — unit tests
- `src/test/setup.ts` — jest-dom setup
- `vite.config.ts` — Vitest config
- `package.json` — test scripts and dev deps
- `README.md` — docs update

## QA Results

- AC1 (LinkedIn link per row): Pass — Renders when `linkedin_url` exists; validated by unit test.
- AC2 (Website link per row): Pass — Renders when website URL exists; validated by unit test.
- AC3 (target/rel): Pass — All links use `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`; validated by unit test.
- AC4 (no placeholder when missing): Pass — Conditional rendering only; verified by unit test.
- AC5 (styling conventions): Pass — Uses shadcn `buttonVariants` (`ghost`) with icons; matches existing patterns.
- AC6 (no impact on sort/select/pagination): Pass — Links call `stopPropagation()`; table has no built-in sort/select; manual smoke click shows no side effects.
- AC7 (unit tests): Pass — Added tests for conditional rendering, a11y labels, and link attributes.
- AC8 (UI documentation): Pass — Updated `README.md` with quick-jump behavior and test command.
- AC9 (no regression on columns/interactions): Pass — Existing columns intact; hover styles unchanged; tests green.
