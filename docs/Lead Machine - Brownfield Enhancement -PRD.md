# Lead Machine Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

This PRD is for significant enhancements to an existing project that require comprehensive planning and multiple stories. It is designed to formalize the requirements for a UI modernization effort.

### Existing Project Overview

- **Analysis Source:** IDE-based fresh analysis from provided codebase
- **Current Project State:** The project is a Node.js web application. The core functionality appears to revolve around a lead search and display table. My analysis of the codebase confirms its purpose is to process and display lead data.

### Available Documentation Analysis

Based on the codebase review, the project currently lacks formal documentation for technical stacks, architecture, or coding standards. The primary source for this PRD is the codebase itself and the enhancement details you provided.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

- **Enhancement Type:** Major Feature Modification & UI/UX Overhaul
- **Enhancement Description:** The enhancement aims to modernize the existing lead management UI by incorporating a numorphism design style, a dynamic progress bar for real-time feedback, a pie chart for lead grading, and an overhaul of the lead display table to include more data and functionality.
- **Impact Assessment:** Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)

### Goals and Background Context

- **Goals:**
    - To create an engaging and exciting user experience.
    - To implement a very nice new morphism style for the look and feel.
    - To convey the overall impression of a very high-end, technologically advanced, and expensive application.

- **Background Context:** This enhancement is needed to update the current application's UI to a modern standard. The existing UI is rendering badly and lacks the visual appeal and real-time feedback necessary to provide a high-end user experience. The proposed changes will address these issues by providing users with clear status updates and a visually engaging interface.

## Requirements

These requirements are based on my understanding of your existing system and the details you have provided. Please review carefully and confirm they align with your project's reality.

### Functional

1. **FR1:** The system shall display a horizontal progress bar in a numorphism style when a lead search is initiated. The bar must have a light yellow to green gradient and provide visual progress feedback.
2. **FR2:** The progress bar shall receive and display four distinct status updates from the backend: "Beginning lead search", "searching web, OSINT sources, for matching prospects", "Cross reference and data enrichment", and "Data validation via Regex, DQFS."
3. **FR3:** The system shall update the progress bar to a final state with a "Report ready" message upon completion of the lead search.
4. **FR4:** The system shall display a pie chart above the lead table, generated simultaneously with the table data.
5. **FR5:** The pie chart shall aggregate and display data based on lead titles, presence of a valid phone number, and presence of a valid email address.
6. **FR6:** The system shall assign points to leads based on their title, email, and phone number, and this scoring will be reflected in the pie chart.
7. **FR7:** The lead display table shall be overhauled to include additional columns that map to the results from the N8N workflow.
8. **FR8:** The overhauled lead table shall support dynamic sorting of its columns.
9. **FR9:** The overhauled lead table shall provide quick-jumping functionality for embedded URLs (e.g., website and LinkedIn).
10. **FR10:** The entire user interface shall be styled according to a new numorphism design, with specific gradient outlines on components.

### Non Functional

1. **NFR1:** The UI must maintain a smooth and responsive feel, even during long-running backend processes.
2. **NFR2:** The numorphism styling must be applied consistently across all UI elements, including buttons, cards, and input fields.
3. **NFR3:** The color palette and visual design of the page must reflect the brand's yellow-to-green color scheme.
4. **NFR4:** The application's performance should not degrade when rendering the new UI components and data tables.
5. **NFR5:** The entire UI, including all new components, must be implemented in a way that allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements.

### Compatibility Requirements

1. **CR1:** New features must not introduce any breaking changes to existing backend APIs.
2. **CR2:** Any data model changes required for the new features must be backward-compatible with the existing data structure.
3. **CR3:** The new UI/UX must maintain a consistent look and feel with any existing pages that are not being overhauled.
4. **CR4:** The new UI must seamlessly integrate with the existing Node.js backend without requiring a major architectural refactor.

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

This section captures the high-level UI/UX vision to guide the UX Expert and inform story creation.

- **Integration with Existing UI:** The new numorphism UI elements will be designed to work alongside existing application components, replacing them where specified.
- **Modified/New Screens and Views:** The entire main web app page will be overhauled, including a new hero section and logo treatment.
- **UI Consistency Requirements:** All new and modified UI elements will adhere to the numorphism style with a specific gradient outline that transitions from white in the top-left to dark gray in the bottom-right. The brand's yellow and green color palette must be applied consistently.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

This section defines the technical constraints and integration requirements based on my analysis of the codebase.

- **Existing Technology Stack:**
    - **Languages:** JavaScript (Node.js)
    - **Frameworks:** Unspecified, but appears to be a web application.
    - **Package Manager:** npm

- **Integration Approach:** The new UI components must seamlessly integrate with the existing backend services that provide the lead data and status updates. The integration should not require changes to the backend API or data structures unless absolutely necessary.

- **Code Organization and Standards:** Based on my analysis, new code should follow the existing file and folder structure. Any new CSS should be organized in a way that respects the current styling approach.

- **Risk Assessment and Mitigation:**
    - **Technical Risks:** The primary risk is the tightly coupled nature of certain services and the potential for new changes to introduce unexpected side effects.
    - **Mitigation:** We will implement the new features in a modular way, ensuring clear boundaries and minimal impact on existing code. We will use a QA agent later to perform a comprehensive regression test to ensure existing functionality remains intact.

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

Based on my analysis of your existing project, I believe this enhancement should be structured as a **single epic** because all four of your enhancements (progress bar, pie chart, table, and UI overhaul) are related and contribute to a unified UI modernization goal.

### Epic 1: Lead Management UI Overhaul

**Epic Goal**: To deliver a modern, high-end numorphism-style user interface that provides an engaging experience and real-time feedback during the lead search process, while maintaining all existing core functionality and a cohesive design.

**Integration Requirements**: All new UI components must seamlessly integrate with the existing backend services for lead data and status updates without requiring breaking API changes. The new UI must also be modular to allow for easy maintenance and future enhancements.
