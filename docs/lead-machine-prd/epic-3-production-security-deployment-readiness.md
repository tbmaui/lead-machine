# Epic 3: Production Security, Deployment & Client Readiness

**Epic Goal**: To secure and prepare the Lead Machine application for production deployment to clients by implementing essential security measures, robust error handling, comprehensive testing, production-grade infrastructure requirements, and client-ready UI polish.

**Integration Requirements**: All security and infrastructure enhancements must maintain full compatibility with the existing Supabase data model, N8N workflow integrations, and functionality established in Epic 1 & 2. The production-ready application must preserve all existing features while providing enterprise-grade security, stability, and monitoring capabilities.

## Epic Context
