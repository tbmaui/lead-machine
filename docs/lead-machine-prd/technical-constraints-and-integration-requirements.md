# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

This section documents technical constraints and integration requirements based on my analysis of your existing project and the provided `README.md` file.

**Existing Technology Stack:**
* **Frontend Framework**: React
* **Language**: TypeScript
* **Build Tool**: Vite
* **UI Library**: shadcn-ui
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
* **Backend Services**: Supabase, N8N

**Integration Approach:**
* **UI Integration**: New UI components will integrate with the existing React-based, single-page application structure.
* **API Integration**: The enhancement must not introduce any breaking changes to the existing webhook call to N8N.
* **Database Integration**: The new UI components must be compatible with the existing Supabase data schema for leads and status updates.

**Risk Assessment and Mitigation:**
* **Technical Risks**: The primary risk is breaking the existing data integration with Supabase and the webhook call to N8N during the UI refactoring.
* **Mitigation Strategies**: We will implement the changes incrementally, starting with isolated components, and we will rely on the existing, well-functioning backend services to avoid any disruption.
