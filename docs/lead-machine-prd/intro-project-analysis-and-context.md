# Intro Project Analysis and Context

This PRD is for SIGNIFICANT enhancements to existing projects that require comprehensive planning and multiple stories.
Before proceeding:

1. **Assess Enhancement Complexity**: This is a major enhancement with a significant impact, which justifies the use of this full PRD process.
2. **Project Context**: The codebase is the single source of truth for the existing system. The documentation created by Lovable is noted as being potentially incomplete.
3. **Deep Assessment Requirement**: The recommendations made in this document are grounded in the analysis of the existing project, including its codebase and the provided `README.md` file.
4. **Continuous Validation**: All assumptions have been explicitly validated with the user.

**Existing Project Overview**

* **Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis and user-provided information.
* **Current Project State**: The project is a one-page web app that serves as the front end to a lead generation application. The backend integrations with Supabase and N8N are fully functional.

**Documentation Analysis**

* **Available Documentation**:
    * Tech Stack Documentation
    * Source Tree/Architecture
    * Coding Standards
    * API Documentation
    * External API Documentation
    * UX/UI Guidelines
    * Technical Debt Documentation
    * "Other: The codebase's README file."
* **Note**: Critical documentation is being created during this process.

**Enhancement Scope Definition**

* **Enhancement Type**: Major Feature Modification and UI/UX Overhaul.
* **Enhancement Description**: You want to refine the frontend UI, change the style to a new "Neumorphism" look, and improve the display of search results and real-time status updates.
* **Impact Assessment**: Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes).

**Goals and Background Context**

* **Goals**:
    * To refine the overall look and feel of the front-end UI to a "Neumorphism" style.
    * To improve the display of lead results in a well-formatted table that fits all the data on one screen.
    * To create a visually appealing, functional, and moving status bar that displays real-time updates from N8N via Supabase.
    * To make changes to the search query inputs.
* **Background Context**: The existing system is a one-page web app that serves as a frontend for a lead generation application. The backend integrations with Supabase and N8N are fully functional, and the webhook from the frontend is working correctly. The current issues are limited to the UI and the display of results and updates.
