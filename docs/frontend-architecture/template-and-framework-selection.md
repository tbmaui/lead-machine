# Template and Framework Selection

This section documents the foundational choices for the frontend project and any constraints imposed by the existing codebase.

I have reviewed the `README.md` file from your GitHub repository. It clearly states that the project is built with:
* Vite
* TypeScript
* React
* shadcn-ui
* Tailwind CSS

Since your project already has an existing codebase based on a starter template (`Lovable` which uses Vite and React), my architecture design will align with its established patterns, including the folder structure and styling approach. I will not suggest a new starter template or framework.
