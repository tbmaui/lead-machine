# UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for your project's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas
* **User Who Needs to Find Leads**: This user needs to quickly and efficiently input search queries and receive accurate, well-formatted results. They value speed and clarity.
* **User Who Needs to Monitor Progress**: This user is interested in the status of the long-running workflow. They value clear, real-time feedback and a visually engaging way to track progress.

### Usability Goals
* **Efficiency**: Users should be able to complete their core tasks (submitting a query, viewing results) with minimal friction.
* **Clarity**: The UI should be easy to understand, with clear labels and intuitive interactions.
* **Feedback**: The system should provide immediate and clear feedback on every user action, especially during the long-running workflow.

### Design Principles
* **Neumorphism**: The UI will adhere to a Neumorphism design style, with a cohesive color palette that supports both light and dark modes.
* **Progressive Disclosure**: Only show information when it is needed, for example, displaying the status bar and results table only after a query has been submitted.
* **Visual Hierarchy**: The most important information (e.g., lead data, status updates) should be visually prominent and easy to find.

## Information Architecture (IA)
