# Testing Requirements

### Component Test Template

TypeScript

// src/components/custom/Button.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Button } from './Button';

test('renders button with correct text', () => {
  render(<Button>Click Me</Button>);
  const buttonElement = screen.getByText(/Click Me/i);
  expect(buttonElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});

### Testing Best Practices

Unit Tests: Test individual components in isolation.

Integration Tests: Test component interactions to ensure they work together correctly.

E2E Tests: Not required for this project scope.

Coverage Goals: Aim for 80% code coverage on all new and modified files.

Test Structure: Use the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests.

Mock External Dependencies: Mock API calls to ensure tests are fast and reliable.
