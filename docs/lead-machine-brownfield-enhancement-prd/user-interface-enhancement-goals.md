# User Interface Enhancement Goals

This section captures the high-level UI/UX vision to guide the UX Expert and inform story creation.

- **Integration with Existing UI:** The new numorphism UI elements will be designed to work alongside existing application components, replacing them where specified.
- **Modified/New Screens and Views:** The entire main web app page will be overhauled, including a new hero section and logo treatment.
- **UI Consistency Requirements:** All new and modified UI elements will adhere to the numorphism style with a specific gradient outline that transitions from white in the top-left to dark gray in the bottom-right. The brand's yellow and green color palette must be applied consistently.
