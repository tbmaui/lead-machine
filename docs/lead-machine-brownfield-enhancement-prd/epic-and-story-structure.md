# Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

Based on my analysis of your existing project, I believe this enhancement should be structured as a **single epic** because all four of your enhancements (progress bar, pie chart, table, and UI overhaul) are related and contribute to a unified UI modernization goal.

### Epic 1: Lead Management UI Overhaul

**Epic Goal**: To deliver a modern, high-end numorphism-style user interface that provides an engaging experience and real-time feedback during the lead search process, while maintaining all existing core functionality and a cohesive design.

**Integration Requirements**: All new UI components must seamlessly integrate with the existing backend services for lead data and status updates without requiring breaking API changes. The new UI must also be modular to allow for easy maintenance and future enhancements.

### Stories

**Story 1.1: Core UI Framework and Branding**
* **As a** user,
* **I want** the application to have a consistent visual identity that reflects a high-end brand,
* **So that** I have a professional and engaging user experience.
* **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1. The page hero section is redesigned in a numorphism style.
    2. The brand logo is updated with a new treatment.
    3. The application uses a consistent yellow and green color palette.
    4. Buttons and interactive elements have appropriate numorphism animations and hover states.
    5. The overall page layout and feel are updated to a modern numorphism design.

**Story 1.2: Dynamic Progress Bar**
* **As a** user who initiates a lead search,
* **I want** to see real-time updates on the progress of the search,
* **So that** I know the process is active and what stage it is in.
* **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1. A horizontal progress bar is displayed upon initiating a lead search.
    2. The bar has a numorphism style with a yellow-to-green gradient.
    3. It receives and displays four distinct status updates from the backend.
    4. An animation is displayed with the progress bar as it fills from 0% to 100%.
    5. The final state displays a "Report ready" message.

**Story 1.3: Interactive Lead Pie Chart**
* **As a** user viewing lead search results,
* **I want** a visual summary of the lead quality,
* **So that** I can quickly understand the distribution of my results.
* **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1. A pie chart is rendered above the lead table when search results are available.
    2. The pie chart displays an aggregate grade of the leads based on assigned points.
    3. The chart's categories are based on prospect titles, phone numbers, and valid email addresses.
    4. Leads with higher titles are assigned a higher point value.

**Story 1.4: Enhanced Lead Display Table**
* **As a** user reviewing lead data,
* **I want** a clear and functional table to view and sort leads,
* **So that** I can efficiently analyze and access prospect information.
* **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1. The lead display table is updated to a new numorphism style.
    2. The table includes new columns that correspond to the data from the N8N workflow.
    3. Users can dynamically sort the table data by any column.
    4. The table provides quick-jumping links to LinkedIn profiles and website URLs.
    5. The table's visual style is consistent with the new brand colors and overall page design.
