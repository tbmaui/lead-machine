# Intro Project Analysis and Context

This PRD is for significant enhancements to an existing project that require comprehensive planning and multiple stories. It is designed to formalize the requirements for a UI modernization effort.

### Existing Project Overview

- **Analysis Source:** IDE-based fresh analysis from provided codebase
- **Current Project State:** The project is a Node.js web application. The core functionality appears to revolve around a lead search and display table. My analysis of the codebase confirms its purpose is to process and display lead data.

### Available Documentation Analysis

Based on the codebase review, the project currently lacks formal documentation for technical stacks, architecture, or coding standards. The primary source for this PRD is the codebase itself and the enhancement details you provided.

- Tech Stack Documentation: ❌ FAIL
- Source Tree/Architecture: ❌ FAIL
- Coding Standards: ❌ FAIL
- API Documentation: ❌ FAIL
- External API Documentation: ❌ FAIL
- UX/UI Guidelines: ❌ FAIL
- Technical Debt Documentation: ❌ FAIL
- Other: User-provided enhancement description

### Enhancement Scope Definition

- **Enhancement Type:** Major Feature Modification & UI/UX Overhaul
- **Enhancement Description:** The enhancement aims to modernize the existing lead management UI by incorporating a numorphism design style, a dynamic progress bar for real-time feedback, a pie chart for lead grading, and an overhaul of the lead display table to include more data and functionality.
- **Impact Assessment:** Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)

### Goals and Background Context

- **Goals:**
    - To create an engaging and exciting user experience.
    - To implement a very nice new morphism style for the look and feel.
    - To convey the overall impression of a very high-end, technologically advanced, and expensive application.

- **Background Context:** This enhancement is needed to update the current application's UI to a modern standard. The existing UI is rendering badly and lacks the visual appeal and real-time feedback necessary to provide a high-end user experience. The proposed changes will address these issues by providing users with clear status updates and a visually engaging interface.
