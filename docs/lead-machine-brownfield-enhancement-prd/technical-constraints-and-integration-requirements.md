# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

This section defines the technical constraints and integration requirements based on my analysis of the codebase.

- **Existing Technology Stack:**
    - **Languages:** JavaScript (Node.js)
    - **Frameworks:** Unspecified, but appears to be a web application.
    - **Package Manager:** npm

- **Integration Approach:** The new UI components must seamlessly integrate with the existing backend services that provide the lead data and status updates. The integration should not require changes to the backend API or data structures unless absolutely necessary.

- **Code Organization and Standards:** Based on my analysis, new code should follow the existing file and folder structure. Any new CSS should be organized in a way that respects the current styling approach.

- **Risk Assessment and Mitigation:**
    - **Technical Risks:** The primary risk is the tightly coupled nature of certain services and the potential for new changes to introduce unexpected side effects.
    - **Mitigation:** We will implement the new features in a modular way, ensuring clear boundaries and minimal impact on existing code. We will use a QA agent later to perform a comprehensive regression test to ensure existing functionality remains intact.
