# User Interface Enhancement Goals

For UI changes, we need to capture how they will integrate with existing UI patterns and design systems.

**Integration with Existing UI:**
* The new UI elements will fit with the existing design patterns and style guides.
* The application will maintain a one-page web app structure.

**Modified/New Screens and Views:**
* The primary modification will be the main dashboard view, which displays search inputs, a status bar, and lead results.

**UI Consistency Requirements:**
* The UI must be visually consistent with the new "Neumorphism" style.
* The UI must include a dark mode option.
* The lead results table must be responsive and display all data on one screen.
* The status bar must have a distinct visual style and functional behavior.
