# Terms of Service Integration Instructions

## ‚úÖ Setup Complete

I've successfully created the infrastructure for your Terms of Service:

### Files Created:
1. `src/components/legal/TermsOfService.tsx` - Modal component to display TOS
2. `src/components/legal/TermsContent.tsx` - Template for your TOS content
3. Updated `src/components/Footer.tsx` - Added functional TOS link

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Terms of Service link in footer is functional
- ‚úÖ Modal opens when clicked
- ‚úÖ Professional modal design with scrolling
- ‚úÖ Placeholder content structure ready
- ‚è≥ **Needs actual content from your .docx file**

## üîÑ Next Steps to Complete Integration:

Since I cannot read .docx files directly, please follow these steps:

### Option 1: Copy & Paste Content (Recommended)
1. Open your `Lead Machine - TOS.docx` file
2. Copy the text content (section by section)
3. Open `src/components/legal/TermsContent.tsx` 
4. Replace each `[Please paste content...]` placeholder with the actual content
5. Update section titles to match your document

### Option 2: Provide Text File
1. Save your .docx file as a .txt file
2. I can then read it and populate the content automatically

### Option 3: Paste Content Here
You can paste the content from your TOS document in our chat, and I'll integrate it into the component.
