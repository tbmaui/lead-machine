# Logo Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Issue Fixed
The logo was not displaying on Vercel deployment because:

1. **Path Issues**: The original logo was in `/ui - ux/complete-controller-logo_no_pad.png` with spaces in the folder name, which can cause issues on production servers
2. **Static Asset Location**: Vercel serves static assets from `/public` directory, but the logo was in a non-standard location
3. **Import Method**: Using direct path references instead of proper ES6 imports for better bundling

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Logo Component (`src/components/Logo.tsx`)
- Now uses ES6 import: `import logoImage from '@/assets/complete-controller-logo.png'`
- Added fallback mechanism using `onError` handler
- Improved sizing: `h-12` instead of `h-24 pt-8` for better header proportions

### 2. Dual Location Strategy
- **Primary**: Logo in `src/assets/` (bundled by Vite for optimal delivery)
- **Fallback**: Logo in `public/` (served as static asset if import fails)

### 3. TypeScript Support
- Added image module declarations in `src/vite-env.d.ts`
- Ensures proper TypeScript support for PNG/JPG/SVG imports

### 4. Logo Replacement
- Replaced with new "Complete Controller Clear Logo" provided by client
- Higher quality and clearer branding

## Files Modified
- `src/components/Logo.tsx` - Updated component logic
- `src/vite-env.d.ts` - Added image import types
- `src/assets/complete-controller-logo.png` - New logo file
- `public/complete-controller-logo-new.png` - Fallback logo file

## Verification
- Build test passed: `npm run build` âœ…
- Logo appears in bundle: `complete-controller-logo-Ci4dmMEO.png`
- Fallback mechanism in place for reliability

This fix ensures the logo will work reliably on Vercel and other deployment platforms.
